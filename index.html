                        Facebook Messenger is getting three new features in an update for its mobile app. The new
                        features include three new chat themes, a quick reply bar, along with QR code scanning and
                        payment links. The update will be rolled out for its Android and iOS apps. The social media
                        giant mentioned that the QR code and payment links option is rolling out for users of the app in
                        the US as of now. The new themes will be available on both Messenger and Instagram.

                    </p>
                    <p>The update for Messenger was announced on Facebook's blog on June 10. The update for the
                        messaging app brings three new themes in celebration Olivia Rodrigo, Fast & Furious 9 (F9), and
                        World Oceans Day. The theme for Olivia Rodrigo marks her debut album, Sour, that was released on
                        May 21. The F9 theme has been released to celebrate 20 years of the Fast and Furious franchise.
                        The theme for World Oceans Day - celebrated on June 8 - apparently lets you virtually explore
                        the oceans around the world while also promoting sustainability..</p>
